# Statis Chamber
Statis Chamber (manned by a team of surgeons) allows a player an attempt to "cross the Rubicon Primaris" (to have the Rubicon Surgery to become a Rubicon Space Marine).  The 1st to attempt it is 60% chance to succeed.  Each one thereafter has a +20% chance with a max chance of 98%.

If a player dies, a standard drop pod replacement occurs.  It is best to wait for a mortal wound before attempting to cross the Rubicon Primaris.

If the surgery is successful, the player is upgraded to Primaris, and given a new set of Mark X space marine armor.

Mark VII armor - Standard Space Marine Armor
Mark X armor
Gravis Mark X armor - +1 toughness, +1 wounds
